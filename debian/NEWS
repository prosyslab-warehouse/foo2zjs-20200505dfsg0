foo2zjs (20200505dfsg0-2ubuntu1) impish; urgency=medium

  Update: Patch for links in getweb script replaced by one to switch
  to https://www.quirinux.org/. The old patch changing the links to
  https://foo2zjs.linkevich.net is still included in the source
  package so that after editing debian/patches/series one can rebuild
  with these links.

foo2zjs (20200505dfsg0-1ubuntu1) impish; urgency=medium

  The upstream home of foo2zjs, http://foo2zjs.rkkda.com/ has ceased
  to work. Most probably the original author, Rick Richardson has
  given up on this project. So their will also no furtyher upstream
  versions if no one will overtake the project. Rick's last change
  happened on June 10, 2020, only one change after the version we use.

  The Debian/Ubuntu package up to now was based on his second last
  change, on May 5, 2020. This was the last change actually affecting
  Linux, the last one was only for Mac OS. I have found this last
  tarball here, on a site of another person who wants to conserve this
  driver package:

    https://foo2zjs.linkevich.net/

  as

    https://foo2zjs.linkevich.net/foo2zjs/foo2zjs.orig.tar.gz

  and a modified one (only file getweb.in, to grab the firmware/ICM
  files from the new site):

    https://foo2zjs.linkevich.net/foo2zjs/foo2zjs.tar.gz

  I did not switch to this new "upstream" tarball as with it, the
  package did not build any more. but I have merged the updated links
  of the tarball's getweb.in file into ours, so that the getweb
  utility continues to work, taking the files from the new site.

  Someone has created a GitHub for this project here

    https://github.com/koenkooi/foo2zjs

  It is a snapshot of the stone-old edition from October 24, 2015 but
  it also contains all the firmware/ICM files. It contains a patch

    https://github.com/koenkooi/foo2zjs/pull/3/files

  to change getweb.in to grab the firmware/ICM files from

    https://www.quirinux.org/

  These printers are old, but if someone has still a working one and
  toner for it can easily save it from the bin with this package and
  the mentioned resources.

  But thanks, Rick Richardson, for this great work anyway, you have
  made these long years before the advent of driverless IPP printing
  much easier for us!

foo2zjs (20090908dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  Starting with this version all HP firmwares are looked for into
  /lib/firmware/hp/ instead of upstream /usr/share/foo2zjs/firmware/
  (thus solving bug #517957).

  The upstream /usr/bin/getweb and /lib/udev/hplj1000 scripts have
  been patched to use this new location.  foo2zjs postinst should
  automatically handle the migration of every firmware present in
  the old location to the new one.
